#  📚 Autocomplete

Hi,
I'm Yoann, I'm currently deepening my knowledge in web development. I'm specialized in React frontend development.
I had fun coding all these projects!
Feel free to ask me questions and don't hesitate to look at my other projects ;)
Have fun coding!

## ✍️ Description 

The goal of this challenge is to discover a new type of input field that offers a large list of options in the form of a dropdown with an autocomplete search field via an API. Impressive, right?

Based on the Address API of data.gouv.fr, create an input that can perform a search and display the suggestions returned by the API following the following constraints:

- The input should be created using the react-native-autocomplete-dropdown library and must have the placeholder "Search city".
- The selected city must be displayed along with its department and region (e.g., 75, Paris, Île-de-France).

This challenge is suitable for developers who want to improve their skills with React and API integration. Feel free to fork this project and start coding!
